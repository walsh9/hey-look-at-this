# Hey, look at this.

Sometimes I want to share a few Tweets as a group but something like Storify is just too much of a hassle.

This JavaScript app will let you paste in a list of tweet/vine/etc urls and turn them into a simple page with embedded tweets/vines/etc.

You can put the tweets in any order you want.

You can also put little comments.

# Todo

- Add tests
- Connect with a URL shortening API
- Find better way to explain this. Maybe with pictures.
