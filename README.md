# Hey, look at this

Sometimes I want to share a few Tweets as a group but something like Storify is just too much of a hassle.

This JavaScript mini-app will let you paste a list of tweet urls and turn them into a simple page with embedded tweets.

You can put the tweets in any order you want.

You can also put little comments.

# Todo

- Tests
- Allow embedding other things (instagram?, youtube?)
- Maybe do this with oembed
- Clean up code
